# Move.js

  CSS3 JavaScript animation framework.

## About

  Move.js is a small JavaScript library making CSS3 backed animation
  extremely simple and elegant. Be sure to view the `./examples`,
  and view the [documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/move.js/).

## Example

  For example below we translate to the point `(500px, 200px)`,
  rotate by `180deg`, scale by `.5`, skew, and alter colors within a 2 second
  duration. Once the animation is complete we `then()` fade out the element by setting the `opacity` to `0`, and shrink it with `scale(0.1)`.

    move('.square')
      .to(500, 200)
      .rotate(180)
      .scale(.5)
      .set('background-color', '#888')
      .set('border-color', 'black')
      .duration('2s')
      .skew(50, -10)
      .then()
        .set('opacity', 0)
        .duration('0.3s')
        .scale(0.1)
        .pop()
      .end();

## Build

 Move is packaged with a minified version, re-built each release. To do this yourself simply execute:

     $ make move.min.js

 We can also pass flags to uglifyjs:
 
     $ make UGLIFY_FLAGS=--no-mangle

## Ender Integratiion

Got [Ender](http://ender.no.de)?

    $ npm install ender -g

Add move.js to your existing Ender build:

    $ ender add movejs

Then code...

``` js
$('.square').move()
  .to(500, 200)
  .rotate(180)
  .scale(.5)
  .set('background-color', '#888')
  .set('border-color', 'black')
  .duration('2s')
  .skew(50, -10)
  .then()
    .set('opacity', 0)
    .duration('0.3s')
    .scale(0.1)
    .pop()
  .end();
```
